# Quick description  
The Ice Cloud Storage API, a high-performance storage API written in C# with ASP.NET Core  
  
# Description  
This is an API, used for storing data in the cloud (duh!) and it's written in C# with ASP.NET Core (duh! as well)  
It can store "notes" and files  
There are 4 plans:  
Plan 1 (Free): 7.5 GB of data max, no activation cost, limited to 1000 requests per week
Plan 2 (Standard): 15 GB of data max, activation cost is 5$, 0.5$ per 1000 reqs (Currently unavailable)  
Plan 3 (Pro): 30 GB of data max, activation cost is 10$, 0.6$ per 1000 reqs (Currently unavailable)  
Plan 4 (Ultra): 60 GB of data max, activation cost is 20$, 0.7$ per 1000 reqs (Currently unavailable)  
NOTE: Your API key can get deactivated if requests cost isn't paid on every month (eg let's say you have to pay 4$ because 4000 reqs were made, if your credit/debit/prepaid card does not have enough money, it will deactivate your key when it tries to pay every month)  
NOTE: For each 1 GB of data (whether it's on a note or a file), an extra 1$ will be charged (so 1 MB = 0.0009765625$) (Won't apply to Plan 1)  
NOTE: We will try to bump up storage capacity for every plan
