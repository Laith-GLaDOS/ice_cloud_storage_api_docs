# Quick description  
The Ice Cloud Storage API, a high-performance storage API written in Rust with Rocket.rs  
  
# Description  
This is an API, used for storing data in the cloud (duh!) and it's written in Rust with Rocket.rs (duh! as well)  
It can store "notes" and files  
There are 3 plans:  
Plan 1 (Standard): 15 GB of data max, activation cost is 5$, 1$ per 1000 reqs  
Plan 2 (Pro): 30 GB of data max, activation cost is 10$, 2$ per 1000 reqs  
Plan 3 (Ultra): 60 GB of data max, activation cost is 20$, 3$ per 1000 reqs  
NOTE: Your API key can get deactivated if requests cost isn't paid on every month (eg let's say you have to pay 4$ because 4000 reqs were made, if your credit/debit/prepaid card does not have enough money, it will deactivate your key when it tries to pay every month)
